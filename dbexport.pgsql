10	Powdered Buttermilk Beignets With Raspberry and Chocolate Dipping Sauce	SPOONACULAR	45	30	{}	{"antipasti","starter","snack","appetizer","antipasto","hor d'oeuvre"}	1 Raspberry Sauce:In a saucepan, add the frozen raspberries and powdered sugar.Bring to a simmer and cook for about 3-4 minutes.Gently mash the raspberries with the back of a spatula while they cook.After 4 minutes, remove from heat and add the raspberry jam.  You could puree this mixture before serving, but I prefer it chunky.Chocolate Sauce:In a saucepan, add the chocolate chips and cream.Allow the chocolate chips to melt, stirring occasionally.\n1 Heat the 1% milk in a saucepan.Once it starts to simmer, remove pan from heat and add the buttermilk.\n2 Pour milk into a standing mixer.To the milk, whisk in the yeast and sugar.\n3 Let sit until foamy, approximately 5 minutes.In a separate bowl, mix the flours, baking soda and salt.Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly add the flour mixture until just incorporated and dough is in the shape of a ball and is slightly sticky.Cover the standing mixer bowl with saran wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free location for about an hour.After an hour, lightly flour your work surface and pour out your dough.Using as little flour as possible, fold the dough over in half and tuck in the edges to make a ball.Flatten the ball and with a floured rolling pin.\n4 Roll the ball out into a circle until the circle is about  an inch thick.Using a knife or other sharp object cut the dough into any shape you want.  I find that cutting the dough into long and thick logs makes the beignets good for dipping.\n5 Let sit for a few minutes.In the meantime, pour canola oil into a Dutch oven until the oil is about 2-3 inches deep.\n6 Heat oil to 375 degrees.Once oil is hot, drop in the dough  4-5 at a time and turn frequently.Allow to fry for 2-3 minutes, or until a lovely golden dark brown.\n7 Transfer the beignets to a drain on a paper towel lined plate.\n8 Add some powdered sugar to the brown paper bag and drop in 3-4 beignets.Close the bag and shake until the beignets are completely covered in powdered sugar.\n9 Serve warm with the dipping sauces.\n	{"sauce pan","spatula","frying pan","blender","whisk","rolling pin","bowl","knife","dutch oven","paper towels"}	VOID	image-5be881f0.jpeg	{}
12	Peppermint Brookie Pies - gluten free, dairy free	SPOONACULAR	45	16	{}	{"antipasti","starter","snack","appetizer","antipasto","hor d'oeuvre"}	1 Preheat oven to 375 F.For the pies:Fill a medium saucepan (relatively the same size as the bowl) about 1/3 full with water and set over medium heat.In a medium glass bowl, combine the bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and shortening.When the water simmers, place the bowl of chocolate and shortening over the simmering water and lower the heat. Make sure your bowl does not touch the simmering water. The more you stir the shinier your cookies will be.When the chocolate and shortening has melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it's completely mixed. Set aside to cool a few minutes.Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla paste, and espresso. Set aside.In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.\n2 Whisk the melted chocolate into the sugar/egg mixture.\n3 Add the flour mixture, whisk. Only whisk until blended, over-mixing can affect the texture of the pies.Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, no need to grease the paper.Drop a heaping tablespoon of batter (keeping the shapes as round as possible) onto the baking sheets. You are aiming for rounds that are about 2 inches in diameter.

When the mixture reaches 220 degrees F it is ready for the stand mixer.Meanwhile, in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on medium speed until it begins to look very foamy(about 3 minutes).Avoiding the whisk, gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon sugar. Increase the speed to high and whip until soft white peaks are formed.At this point check to see if your sugar has cooled. If it has cooled, turn heat back on to high until it comes back up to 220 degrees F just before adding to stand mixer.When egg whites are at a soft peak stage resembling marshmallow fluff,slowly add the hot sugaralong the edge of the mixer avoiding the whisk.Continue to whisk on high until the bowl has cooled, about 5 minutes.\n3 Add peppermint extract, whisk another 30 seconds.Refrigerate for 5 minutes before transferring to a piping bag with a plain tip attached or a large ziploc bag with one corner cut a 1/4 inch.For\n1 Place candy canes between layers of wax paper, then sandwich between a dish towel.Using a meat tenderizer, or the back of a dry measuring cup, pound the candy cane until broken up into very small pieces.Make sure the candy cane is between wax paper first, otherwise, the candy cane will stick to the dish towel.Assemble:Turn the brookie cookies upside down, pipe about 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the cookies.Cover each filled cookie with a dry cookie, press down just enough so that filling adheres to the cookie.\n2 Sprinkle crushed candy cane around the brookie pie edges.\n3 Serve chilled or at room temperature.\n	{"sauce pan","whisk","bowl","oven","baking paper","baking sheet","candy thermometer","stand mixer","blender","meat tenderizer","measuring cup","kitchen towels","wax paper"}	VOID	image-5a105aa3d.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free","fodmap friendly"}

61	Buckwheat Galette With An Egg	SPOONACULAR	45	10	{}	side dish	1 Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined.\n2 Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.\n3 In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour.\n4 Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.\n5 Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).\n6 Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.\n7 Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.\n8 I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.\n9 To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil.\n10 Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.\n11 So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.\n12 When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.\n	{"blender","whisk","pastry brush","frying pan","spatula","stove","pot"}	VOID	image-10e93fa46.jpeg	{"lacto ovo vegetarian"}

Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings.\n6 Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)\n7 Heat the skillet over medium-high heat.\n8 Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan.

Mold into a ball.\n6 Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.\n7 Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this.\n8 Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.Preheat oven to 325F.\n9 Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.\n10 Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies.

Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.\n13 Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily.\n14 Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth.\n15 Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.\n16 Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez\n	{"measuring cup","knife","whisk","stand mixer","bowl","baking paper","spatula","rolling pin","cutting board","oven","offset spatula","baking pan","wire rack","microwave","wax paper"}	VOID	image-699b4f13.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free"}

Once it is incorporated pull it off the heat and set it aside to cool.\n2 Add in the half and half, vanilla extract and heavy cream and stir well (I just used a regular spoon.) Once it is all mixed together stick your saucepan in the freezer while you chop the nuts and prepare the ice cream maker.\n3 Chop the almonds. I did a rough chop and tried to chop them different ways so you get a different size bite each time.\n4 Once you have the nuts chopped and your marshmallows measured out get the ice cream maker bowl out of the freezer and put it in the ice cream maker. Set it up so it is ready to use. Take your chocolate mixture out of the freezer and pour it into the ice cream maker. Turn the ice cream maker on. Set your timer for 35 minutes.\n5 At the 35-minute mark add in your toppings and let it incorporate for another 5 minutes.\n6 Once this is done scoop it out of the ice cream maker and into your freezer containers.

After a couple of minutes, stir and spread out again.\n5 Add cold rice (it separates easily, so it won't clump up during cooking), plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom.\n6 Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy.\n7 Add the peas and broccoli and stir again.\n8 Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat.\n9 Add chopped scallion tops and toss.I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw, chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.Season to taste with salt and, if you'd like, more soy sauce. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with something salty and saucy (ie. teriyaki chicken) you may want to hold off on adding too much salt to the fried rice.\n	{"food processor","frying pan"}	VOID	image-e63643f1.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free","lacto ovo vegetarian",vegan}

205	Easy To Make Spring Rolls	SPOONACULAR	45	4	{Vietnamese,Asian}	side dish	1 Have all the ingredients ready for assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat.\n2 Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients.\n3 Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.

Keep them well covered until they are ready to be used.\n8 Dust a dish generously with flour. This will hold the dumplings once they are made.\n9 Dust the table generously with flour. Carefully separate the sheets of dumpling wrappers and lay them on the table. Fill each wrapper with about 1.5 teaspoons of the prepared pork filling.\n10 Prepare a bowl of water. Dip finger into the water and lightly wet the rim of each dumpling wrapper.\n11 Bring the dumpling wrapper together till the opposite ends meet.

263	Grilled Lemon Garlic Artichokes	SPOONACULAR	45	4	{}	side dish	1 Place chopped thyme, lemon juice and zest and garlic in a glass bowl. Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds then let the herbs seep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom and a steamer rack. Prepare the artichokes. Have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation, use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes, rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown. Use a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke.\n2 Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes.\n3 Cut the artichokes in half. Use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes.\n4 Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves, cut side down on the steam rack. Cover. Steam for 20 minutes or until you can easily pull off the outer leaves, and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife. The artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes, as you will be cooking them further on the grill.Prepare your grill for direct, high heat. Toss the artichokes in the garlic, lemon and thyme infused oil coating liberally.\n5 Sprinkle artichokes with salt and pepper.\n6 Place the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes.\n	{"peeler","microwave","kitchen scissors","bowl","pot","grill","knife"}	VOID	image-f3c536f7.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free",paleolithic,"lacto ovo vegetarian",primal,vegan}

275	Sex in a glass	SPOONACULAR	45	6	{}	side dish	1 To make the espresso bring water to a boil and then pour it over the espresso. Set aside to cool. When cooled add the melted ice cream\n1 Place 1 cup sugar and water in a 2 quart pot with a glass lid. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.\n2 Pour the caramel cream into the coffee and refrigerate until cold.To assemble, fill a glass with ice, scoop two ice cream scoops into each glass.\n3 Pour the iced espresso cream over and top with sweetened whipped cream (the other cup of cream whipped with 1 tablespoon sugar).\n4 Garnish with caramel syrup and serve chilled.\n	pot	VOID	image-6cf4c104e.jpeg	{"gluten free"}
328	Lime S’more Tartlets	SPOONACULAR	45	1	{}	{"lunch","main course","main dish","dinner"}	1 Prepare the graham crust: Preheat the oven to 35\n2 Put the graham crackers into a food processor and pulse until the crackers break down to the consistency of sand.\n3 Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the salt and melted butter and mix until the butter has thoroughly incorporated; it should be the consistency of wet sand.Press and pack the wet graham mixture into six buttered 4 -inch tart pans, making sure it goes up all the way on the sides and that the crust is thick and sturdy.Arrange the tarts on 1 or 2 cookie sheets and bake for 12 minutes, or until the crusts are golden, but not browned.\n1 Put the lime juice, sugar, eggs, and yolks in a stainless steel bowl and whisk well.Fill a saucepan halfway with water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat so the water is simmering. Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. When all of the butter is melted and incorporated, stir in the lime zest and remove the saucepan from the heat.\n2 Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes.\n3 Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until very smooth. You can also use an immersion/hand blender instead, if you have one.The mixture can be made, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 week.Divide the mixture among the tart shells, leaving about half of space on the top for the chocolate ganache layer. Chill in the refrigerator while making the chocolate ganache, or until set.Prepare the chocolate ganache: Over a double boiler (simmer water over low heat in a saucepan and put a heat-resistant bowl on top), melt the chocolate together with the sugar and butter. Stir constantly until the sugar is well incorporated and the mixture is smooth and shiny.\n4 Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.Carefully, pour the liquid chocolate ganache over each tartlet, making sure that the chocolate does not over-flow the graham crust sides. Return the tarts to the refrigerator and chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until the ganache has set. (The ganache on top should take on a smooth matte finish.)Prepare the meringue and finish the tarts: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the reserved egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak. Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.\n5 Transfer the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe it around the edge of each tart. Or, transfer it into a large freezer bag, seal tightly, and snip off one corner. Pipe the meringue on as desired.Using a brulee torch, quickly brown the meringue, being careful not to melt the chocolate ganache on top. (Due to the chocolate ganache layer, the meringues should not be browned under a broiler.)\n	{"oven","food processor","baking sheet","bowl","sauce pan","whisk","pot","double boiler","immersion blender","blender","stand mixer","pastry bag","broiler"}	VOID	image-b41de85f.jpeg	{}

376	Jean's Seafood Gumbo	SPOONACULAR	45	9	{Cajun,Creole}	{"lunch","soup","main course","main dish","dinner"}	1 Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.\n2 Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large "gumbo pot" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\n3 Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called "dead man," or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\n4 Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic\n5 Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\n6 Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove.\n7 Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor.\n8 Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\n9 Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine.\n10 Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\n11 Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot.\n12 Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now.\n13 Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\n14 Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now.\n15 Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\n16 Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease.\n17 Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh.\n18 Add to gumbo pot.\n19 Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended.\n20 Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\n21 Skim any excess fat.\n22 Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\n23 To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.\n	{"pot","stove","frying pan"}	VOID	image-c7c63b92.jpeg	{"dairy free"}

Grease first, line with baking paper and then grease again.\n2 Add 5 large eggs to a large deep mixing bowl.\n3 Add 1 cup of sugar. Feel free to cut this amount by a tablespoon or two if your bananas are very very ripe.

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long.

If pieces remain after you have stirred it for a while then return to microwave for another few seconds and then stir again until it is fully melted. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. You are better off starting with less time and reheating than overheating and ruining it.When chocolate has melted add the sugar and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine.\n2 Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over.

Do not over mix - you just want some swirls.\n8 Place in a preheated 350 degree F oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

Spoon 1 Tbsp mixture on the lower edge of the wrapper leaving 1 inch edge. Begin to fold egg roll like an envelope: first, fold over the lower 1 inch edge over the filing, then the left edge, then the right edge, then roll up to the top edge. To seal the wrapper just moisten the top edge with water. I used the sauce I got from draining the cooked mixture.\n11 Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium high heat.\n12 Place egg roll one at a time into hot oil, with the seam down (this will keep it from unraveling) and then quickly turn the egg roll to ensure the skin crisp up and does not stick to other egg rolls in the pan. Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil.\n13 Place egg roll on layers of paper towels to drain.\n14 Serve the lumpia or Filipino egg rolls with your favorite sweet and sour sauce or a spicy vinegar sauce.\n	{"frying pan","paper towels"}	VOID	image-24a4cadf.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free"}

Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\n7 Drop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.

Allow mixture to cool about 10 minutes before pouring mixture in a large container; refrigerate a few hours until cold.\n5 If using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly.\n6 You can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the ice cream mixture in a freezer-safe container, placing it in the freezer and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but the ice cream will still be great!\n7 If you have leftovers in the freezer, thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in because it will be much stiffer than store-bought ice cream.\n	{"sauce pan","stove","blender","ice cream machine"}	VOID	image-d1764d17.jpeg	{"gluten free","lacto ovo vegetarian"}

Set aside.\n2 Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\n3 Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance.\n4 Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons.\n5 Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\n6 Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways.\n7 Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\n8 Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\n9 Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\n10 Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\n11 In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\n12 Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\n13 Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\n14 With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\n15 Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\n16 Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage.\n17 Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!\n	{"bowl","frying pan","pot","knife","wooden spoon"}	VOID	image-e9eb1a56.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free"}

This will help keep patties from shrinking when cooking.Pre-heat the barbecue to high temperature.I recommend leaving the elk burgers on the tinfoil while cooking on the BBQ. The elk meat is very lean and can have the tendency to dry out if overcooked. Cooking on tinfoil reduces the risk of overcooking.Cook 7 minutes or until brown and then flip patties. Continue cooking on other side until brown  7 minutes.\n4 Add smoked mozzarella cheese to the top of burgers during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Close lid and melt cheese.While cooking your burgers, place pancetta bacon slices on tinfoil and place on the barbeque for the last few minutes of cooking.

Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure, and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls.

Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.\n5 Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.\n6 Cut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.\n7 Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.\n8 Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.\n9 After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.

Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.\n16 After 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!\n17 Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.\n18 Remove as much as you can.\n19 Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.\n20 Remember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.

757	Apple-Cheesecake Tart with Salted Caramel Glaze	SPOONACULAR	45	8	{}	side dish	1 Crust: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla together until lightened. By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds.

Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples).\n4 Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden.\n5 Add the butter and salt and stir to combine.\n6 Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel.

863	Citrus Arugula Salad with Seared Scallops	SPOONACULAR	45	2	{}	{"side dish","salad"}	1 First, you'll want to thinly slice the radishes and cucumber; and, dice the green onion.\n2 In a bowl, squeeze half of the Cara Cara orange and pulp, add salt and whisk together.\n3 Add in the radish and cucumber slices, arugula and toss together.\n4 For the scallops: heat oil in a high heat.\n5 Place the scallops flat-side down in the hot pan. Don't overcrowd the pan, or the pan won't stay hot enough to give the scallops a good sear. If you have a lot of scallops, it's better to work in batches.\n6 Once you've placed the scallops in the pan, don't touch them. (\n7 Let them do their thing!) If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip.\n8 Plate your salad and place 4 scallops on top. Scallops start to turn rubbery if you wait too long to serve them, so get them on the plate right away. And be sure to serve them with the beautiful caramel-colored crust facing up.\n	{"whisk","bowl","frying pan"}	VOID	image-4f6af0de.jpeg	{"gluten free","dairy free",pescatarian}
